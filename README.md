## 👩‍💻 About Me

A passionate and dynamic educator with a robust foundation in IT, coding, and guest services. Currently, I excel as a Coach at KidsUnlimited and serve as Head Tutor at CodeCamp, where I inspire children aged 7–14 to explore chess, science, animation, coding, and robotics through interactive, project-based learning.

With prior experience in IT support, programming instruction, and customer engagement, I thrive on creating environments that spark curiosity and innovation. My technical expertise spans Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, and more, complemented by ongoing postgraduate studies in IT (Digital Leadership). Communication and mentorship are my superpowers—empowering young minds is my mission.
